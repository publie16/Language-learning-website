    <h1>This is the first website I am hosting!</h1>
    <p>This website does not include many options or details but I have tried to keep it interesting. All the code is done in HTML and CSS only. I hope you all like my very first step in this field, and also, it would not be a waste if you explore my website as you will learn a few basic words in these languages! </p>
